Quericity is an end-to-end quiz system, allowing teachers and other users to create, share, serve, grade and analyze quizzes. it's particularly useful for teachers in middle school or high school level subjects and quizzes.

This was done as a software project between Clustox software developers and Patrick McGuinness, with most of the original code authored by Awais Shafqat, plus some contributions by Patrick McGuinness and others. After some efforts at development and commercialization, it was decided to release it to the wild as an open source project.

Quericity is developed as a Ruby-on-Rails web app with AngularJS front end and postgresql database.
